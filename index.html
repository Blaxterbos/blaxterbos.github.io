					<h3>The Elder Wand</h3>
					<p>The Elder Wand was created in the 13th century by Death. When a master is killed, the killer is the new owner of the wand. If the owner dies of a natural cause, nobody else can obtain the wand and the cycle is done. The wand was passed down for thousands of years until it was broken by Harry Potter.</p>

					<p>A <strong>house-elf</strong> (sometimes also referred to as just Elves) is a magical being which is immensely devoted and loyal to the one designated as thier master. House-elves serve wizards and witches and are usually found under the employment of old wizarding families taking residence in elaborate establishments, like mansions, and must do everything that their masters command unless they are fredd. A house-elf can only be freed when their master presents them with clothes.<p>

					<p>A <strong>dementor</strong> is a gliding, wraithlike Dark creature, widely considered to be one of the foulest to inhabit the wizarding world. Dementors feed on human happiness and thus generate feelings of depression and despair in any person in close proximity to them. They can also consume a person's soul, leaving their victims in a permanent vegetative state, and thus are often referred to as "soul-sucking fiends", rendering a person an 'empty-shell'. The Dementors of Azkaban were under the employ of the Ministry.<p>

					<p>A <strong>hippogriff</strong> was a magical beast that had the front legs, wings, and head of a giant eagle and the body, hind legs and tail of a horse. It was very similar to another magical creature, the Griffin, with the horse rear replacing the lion rear. The breeding of fancy Hippogriffs was an established wizarding career, with known breeders including Newton Scamander's mother. Images of fancy Hippogriffs were sometimes put onto calendars. A hippogriff was one rare possible corporeal form of the Patronus Charm.<p>

					<p>The <strong>phoenix</strong> is a large swan-sized scarlet magical bird with red and gold plumage, along with a golden beak and talons, black eyes, and a tail as long as a peacock's. As phoenixes approach their Burning Day they resemble a half-plucked turkey. Their eyes become dull, their feathers start to fall out, and it begins to make gagging noises. Then the bird suddenly bursts into flames only to rise from the ashes shortly after. In a number of days, they grow back to full size.<p>
